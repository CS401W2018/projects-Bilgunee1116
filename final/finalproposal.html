    <p>1. Curry Chronicles: The Legacy of Stephen Curry</p>
    <p>2. My website is called "Curry Chronicles: The Legacy of Stephen Curry." It is about Stephen Curry and his basketball career.</p>
    <p>3. I chose this topic because Stephen Curry is a very exciting and talented basketball player. I enjoy watching him play and I want to share his story, his hard work, and his amazing skills with others. His career shows how passion and practice can lead to great success.</p>
    <p>4. On the home page, I will have an introduction with a big picture of Stephen Curry, a short welcome message, and navigation links to the other pages.</p>
    <p>Page 1 (Biography): This page will tell Curryâ€™s life story, his early years, college career, and NBA journey.</p>
    <p>Page 2 (Career Timeline): This page will show a timeline of important events in his career with simple notes and dates.</p>
    <p>Page 3 (Statistics): This page will include a table that shows numbers like points per game, assists, and other stats over the seasons.</p>
    <p>Page 4 (Gallery): This page will have images and short video clips of Curry in action.
    <p>Page 5 (Fan Zone): This page will have a form where fans can share their favorite Curry moments and opinions.</p>
    <p>5. In the fan form, I will collect the visitor's name, email, favorite Curry moment, a short comment, and a rating of his performance. The table on the statistics page will show data such as the season, points per game, assists, and shooting percentages.</p>
    <p>6. I will get my information, images, and other content from trusted sports websites and news sources. I plan to use at least five references. Two of my main references will be the official NBA website and ESPN. I will also use Basketball Reference, Sports Illustrated, and a few other reliable sports blogs.</p>
    <p>7. I have read all the warnings provided for this assignment.</p>
