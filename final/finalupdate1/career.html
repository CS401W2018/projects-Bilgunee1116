        <h1>Career Highlights</h1>
        <p>Stephen Curry entered the NBA in 2009 as the 7th overall pick. His early career showed glimpses of greatness with elite shooting and handles.</p>
        <p>In 2015, he won his first MVP and led the Warriors to an NBA championship. He would win two more titles and another MVP in 2016, becoming the first unanimous MVP in league history.</p>
        <p>Beyond awards, Curry transformed the game. His limitless range forced defenses to adapt, making the 3-point shot the new standard in basketball.</p>
