        <h1>My Hero - STEPHEN CURRY</h1>
        <p>Steph Curry is one of the greatest basketball players ever, known for his incredible three-point shooting and skillful ball handling. He changed the game by proving that smaller players can dominate with skill, speed, and shooting instead of just size and strength. His success with the Golden State Warriors, including multiple championships and MVP awards, has inspired millions of people worldwide, including me. Curry's influence goes beyond the NBA, motivating young athletes to work on their shooting and believe that dedication and hard work can overcome physical limitations.</p>
