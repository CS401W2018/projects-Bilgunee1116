    <h3 class="green"> Watching NBA games</h3>
        <p> Watching NBA games is exciting because of the fast action, amazing skills, and big moments. Players hit deep three-pointers, make powerful dunks, and play smart defense. The game moves quickly, and anything can change in the last seconds. Watching also helps fans learn more about teamwork and strategy. Whether it is a buzzer-beater or a playoff battle, NBA games are always fun to watch.</p>
        <h3 id="secondpar">Playing Basketball</h3>
        <p>Playing basketball is just as exciting. Scoring a basket, making a good pass, or blocking a shot feels great. It is a sport that needs both skill and teamwork. Playing helps improve fitness, coordination, and focus. More than that, basketball brings people together, whether it is at a park or in a league. The fast pace and energy make it one of the best sports to play.</p>
