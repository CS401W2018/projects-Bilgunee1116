            Basketball is a team sport played between two teams of five players each, where the objective is to score points by shooting a ball through the opponent's hoop, which is mounted 10 feet high. The game is played on a rectangular court with a three-point arc, free-throw line, and key area. Players advance the ball by dribbling or passing and attempt to score while defending their own hoop. It is governed by rules that regulate dribbling, shooting, passing, fouls, and time management.

                <li>Normal flow is how HTML elements naturally appearâ€”block elements stack, and inline elements sit next to each other.</li>
                <li>Float moves an element left or right, letting text wrap around it, but you need to clear it so the parent container does not collapse.</li>
                <li>Relative moves an element from its normal spot, absolute removes it from the flow and positions it based on the nearest ancestor, and fixed stays in place even when scrolling.</li>
                <li>For mobile navigation, use a hamburger menu, flexbox, and big touch-friendly buttons with smooth animations.</li>
